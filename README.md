# 💹Crypto Performance Tracker Dashboard (Excel Project)


## 📘Project Overview

The Crypto Performance Tracker Dashboard was created to simplify how cryptocurrency trends are analyzed and understood.
In a market where prices change rapidly, it can be difficult to track which coins are rising, falling, or remaining stable without using complex software.

To solve this, I built a fully Excel-based dashboard that visually represents the performance of different cryptocurrencies using only Excel formulas, conditional formatting, and charts — with no automation or external tools.

The goal was to make crypto analysis more accessible by turning raw market data into a clean, interactive, and easy-to-read dashboard.
This project shows how Excel alone can be used to transform data into actionable insights that help identify market behavior, trends, and overall performance direction.

## ⚠️Problem Statement

Tracking cryptocurrency movements can be overwhelming, especially when dealing with multiple coins and fluctuating prices.
Most tools require programming or automated data connections, which can be complex for everyday users.

This project addresses that problem by offering a simple, Excel-based solution that allows anyone — from beginners to analysts — to quickly identify:

- Which cryptocurrencies are rising, falling, or stable

- How the percentage change in price affects overall performance

- What the average market trend looks like (bullish or bearish)



## 🧩Data Structure

The dataset was manually created in Excel and includes the following columns:

- Coin Name – the cryptocurrency being tracked

- Open Price – price at the start of the period

- Close Price – price at the end of the period

- Percentage Change – calculates how much the price has risen or fallen

 - Status – automatically shows if the coin is Rising 🔼, Falling 🔻, or Stable ⏸️

- The data is neatly structured in a table format, which feeds directly into the dashboard for visualization.



## 🧠Methodology

The project was executed step by step using Excel’s analytical and visualization tools.
The dataset contains information on various coin features, including Timestamp, Coin name, Open price, Close price,percentage Change, Status, Total, and average.
The folllowing steps was taking to analyze the data.

1. Data Entry: Manually entered crypto data (coin name, open price, close price).


2. Data Processing: Applied formulas such as IF, COUNTIF, and AVERAGE to calculate changes and summarize trends.


3. Status Determination: Used logical conditions to automatically classify each coin’s performance (Rising, Falling, or Stable).


4. Visualization:
- Used conditional formatting to apply visual indicators (green, red, yellow).

- Created charts and slicers for interactivity.

- Designed a dashboard layout that combines clarity and visual appeal.

5. Insights Extraction: Analyzed the color-coded visuals to understand which coins performed best and how the market behaved overall.

## 📊Key Insights and Findings:

Here are few insights that were discovered:

- Percentage change effectively measures market volatility and helps identify strong or weak performers.

- The average performance metric provides a simple way to see whether the overall market is moving upward or downward.

- Color-coded indicators and emojis make the data more interactive and engaging, allowing anyone to interpret market trends easily.

- The project proved that Excel can handle real-world financial analysis tasks without the need for automation or advanced BI tools.



## ⚙️Key Features:

No Automation Needed: Built entirely in Microsoft Excel — no VBA, Python, or external data connections used.

Smart Logic System: Automatically classifies each cryptocurrency’s performance as Rising 🔼, Falling 🔻, or Stable ⏸️.

Clean Data Structure: Organized table layout that updates easily when new data is added.

Visual Storytelling: Uses conditional formatting and emojis to make market behavior instantly understandable.

Dashboard Layout: Includes summary charts, coin table, and average trend visuals for quick insight.

User-Centric Design: Simple enough for non-analysts, yet detailed enough for financial analysis.

## 🧰Tools Used

Microsoft Excel – for data organization, analysis, and dashboard creation

Formulas: IF, COUNTIF, AVERAGE, and conditional logic

Conditional Formatting – for visual indicators and emoji-based trends

Charts & Slicers – to make the dashboard interactive and visually engaging




💡Recommendations

While building this project, I identified several ways it can be improved in future updates:

🔹 Expand the dataset to include more coins and additional performance metrics such as market cap, trading volume, or volatility.

🔹 Introduce historical tracking to visualize how each coin performs over time.

🔹 Use Power Query in the future to automatically import real or recent crypto data from trusted online sources.

🔹 Add summary visuals such as “Top Gainer,” “Top Loser,” or “Market Overview” cards for quick insights.

🔹 Refine dashboard visuals for a modern, minimalist look that communicates data effectively.



## ✅Project Impact

This project helped me strengthen my ability to use Excel for financial and market analysis, especially in situations where automation tools are not available.
It demonstrates how a structured approach and visual design can turn raw data into valuable insights — even using just Excel.
It also reflects my analytical thinking, data visualization skills, and my ability to build practical tools that simplify complex data for decision-making.
